This is Library Management system application.

NOTE: Since there were time restrains, I am not able to optimize or clean the code correctly.
I have added basic functionalities asked in the assignment, but the project lacks some other functionalities.
So, have the above point in mind while evaluation.

This is a full stack application using Spring Boot, Angular and MySQL.
* This is a Library Management System with User side application. 
* User can perform CRUD with books.
* Uses JWT to authenticate login.

# Database
I have used MySQL database here.
We must add few records in DB manually before using application however tables would be created once we start spring boot application with the help of hibernate.

## Authenticate
* Post Mapping to return JWT.

## Book
* Get Mapping to find all books in the database.
* Get Mapping to find book by id provided.
* Post Mapping to create book.
* Put Mapping to edit book.
* Delete Mapping to delete a book.

## User
* Get Mapping to find user by Name provided.
